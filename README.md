# SumOfDice

In this project, I aim to achieve high scores by colliding objects that containing different number values. As the number value of the cubes increases, their weight also increases at a certain rate, so it becomes more difficult for the object with a large number value to go out of the scene. also in this study the reward and punishment system is still being developed.
